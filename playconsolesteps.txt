2. Google Play Console:
Log in to the Google Play Console with your developer account.

Click on "Create app".

Fill in the basic information about your app (name, default language, etc.).

In the left panel, under "Release", you'll find the different types of release tracks: Internal testing, Closed, Open, and Production. For a quick test, use the "Internal testing" track.

Click on "Create new release". Here, you'll be prompted to upload your APK or App Bundle. You can also specify release notes if you want.

Fill in the Store Listing information. This includes app title, description, screenshots, and more.

Fill out the Content Rating questionnaire.

Set up Pricing & Distribution, even if the app is free.

3. Review and Rollout:
Once all required sections are completed:

Go back to "Internal testing" under "Release".

If everything looks good, click on "Start Rollout to Internal testing".

Usually, for internal tests, the app is available quite quickly, though the initial review might add some delay.

4. Inviting Testers:
Once your release is live for testing, you can invite testers by adding their email addresses. They'll receive an email with instructions on how to access the app.
After you're comfortable with the process and the app on the Play Store, you can then tackle the App Store and TestFlight for iOS, which involves a more extensive review process and additional setup in Xcode.

Remember, every app and update goes through a review process. Although the Play Store is typically quicker than the App Store, there might still be a wait, especially for the first submission.
